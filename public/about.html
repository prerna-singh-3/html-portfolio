<h1>Prerna Singh's Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Hi,I'm Prerna,a Web Developer. Nice to meet you.</h2>
<p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer a year ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create websites for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops.</p>

<p>I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.</p>

<p>I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.I genuinely care about people, and enjoy helping them work on their craft.</p>
